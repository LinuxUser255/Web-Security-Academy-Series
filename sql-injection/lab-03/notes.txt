SQLi - Product category filter

End Goal: determine the number of columns returned by the query. 

Background (Union):
The UNION query: 
    Concatonates the results of the two queries into a single result.
    For example, the query: select A, B from Table 1 UNION select C, D from Table 2
    That says: Select the values from columns A and B, from Table 1, plus the values from C and D from Table 2.
    and concatonate the results together.
    

Both Tables: 1 & 2 have two columns each. A & B, and C & D, respectfully.

                  table1      table2
columns -->       A | B       C | D         
                  -----       -----
                  1 , 2       2 , 3        
                  3 , 4       4 , 5

- First Query: 
  Select A, B from table1
      1,2
      3,4
  
- Second Query: 
  Select A, B from table1 UNION select C, D from table2, (catted together by UNION)
      1,2  
      3,4   
      2,3       
      4,5


Rule when using the UNION operator: 
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries
- The data types must be compatible


SQLi attack (first method):
----------------------------------
select ? from table1 UNION select NULL

(If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error
theefore, continue to iterate through the NULL requests until you receive and error, and the
number of NULLs, minus one, is the number of columns contained)

-error -> incorrect number of columns

select ? from table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL
-200 response code -> indicates you have reached the correct number of columns


SQLi attack (2nd method):
-------------------------------------
select a, b from table1 ORDER by 3

So, ORDER by 1, orders by the first column, (A in this example)
    ORDER by 2, orders by the second column, (B in this example)
    ORDER by 3  orders by the third column. (There is no third column and will throw an error.)
    
  Similar to the first method, you will iterate through the ORDER by secuence 1,2,3,4, etch.. untill you receive an error.
