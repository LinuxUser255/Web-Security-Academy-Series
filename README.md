# Web Security Academy Series
This is a forked repo from [**rkhal101's original Web Security Academy Series.**](https://github.com/rkhal101/Web-Security-Academy-Series)

In this version, many of the Python scripts have been refactored as well as expanding many of the notes and adding extra resources.
Think of it being to [**PortSwigger WebAcademy**](https://portswigger.net/web-security) what [**SwissKeyRepo**](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) is to Web App Pentesting payloads - A one stop shop for everything you need, built on the [**FOSS Philosophy.**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FOSS_A_General_Introduction/Introduction)
